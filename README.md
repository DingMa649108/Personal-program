# The Call of Cthulhu(CoC) Gaming Tool

## Proposal

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

<p>Call of Cthulhu is a **horror fiction role-playing game** based on *H. P. Lovecraft's* story of the same name and the 
associated *Cthulhu Mythos*. It requires 1 to 8 players and a host to play. Players will 
make their imaginary characters with unique skills and states. Host will use those characters for a adventure in the 
fantasy world. All the events and actions in this game is decided by dice with different faces(ie. D3, D6, D20, ect).</p>>

<p>This application will help the players to make and manage theri characters in a Call of Cthulhu game. And this
application will also provide dices with different faces for players to use during the game.Mainly, the players will use 
this application. The reason why I am interested in making such a program is I am a big fan of
DND. However, it is really inconvenience to play this game in this special period. So I decide to make an application to
make playing DnD online easier and more manageable.</p>>
